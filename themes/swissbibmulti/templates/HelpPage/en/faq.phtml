<h2>Search, Advanced search</h2>
<ul class="list">
    <li><strong>Search with brackets isn't working as expected</strong>
        <br/>Searches like <i>a AND (b OR c)</i> or <i>(a OR b) NOT c</i> aren't supported. Use several search groups in <i>Advanced search</i> instead.
    </li>
    </ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
<ul class="list">
     <li><strong>What is Sort by Relevance?</strong>
        <br/>Hits in main title, author name and subjects rank higher than hits in other fields. New publications sort before older ones.</li>
      <!--
      <li><strong>The title I am looking for ranks way too low when sorting by relevance</strong>
        <br/>If you know that it is a new title set the date at the bottom of the left hand column to 2000-2014 or 2010-2014 or write <i>20??</i> or <i>201?</i> behind your search terms (this is not as precise as using the date facet).<br/>You can also describe the case to us, contact see below. The sort in 
        <i>Articles &amp; more</i> is set by SerialsSolutions and can't be changed by us.
